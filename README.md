A really basic picture processing software

I'm always amazed that very basic features can require a VIP in the software I use.
For example, painting an area of the picture white.
This is, honestly, not a very complex feature! And frankly, I need it.
So I decided to write a very simple, but free picture programm to solve my  problems.

This will not satisfy most of your needs, but that is not the intention.
It is enough for me.

NEED:
I was quite unable to aquire the height and length of pictures.

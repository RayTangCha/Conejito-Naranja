A really basic picture processing software

## Why this come to be ##
I'm always amazed that very basic features can require a VIP in the software I use.
For example, painting an area of the picture white.
This is, honestly, not a very complex feature! And frankly, I need it.
So I decided to write a very simple, but free picture programm to solve my  problems.

This will not satisfy most of your needs, but that is not the intention.
It is enough for me.

## How to use ##
Actually, most functions are strictly as the button says, but here are some more stuff that needs mentioning.

### Filter a specific color ###
Note that sometimes the picture will come into strange and non-desirable colors (strong greens or blues). This is because the original picture is to light and you need to darken it down with the "Graphite" button which does not look like graphite at all.

### Using "Split" and "Grid: ###
If used well, these two will make the picture look astonishing and truely professional. If not, these will destroy the picture. Note that you may need more than one "Graphite" button clicks to darken it down to a sufficient level. Future versions may provide an "Optimize" button to make this process automatic.

### Using Convolution ###
We have a line of buttons on the right that involves the use of convolution. These buttons provide astonishing features as well as the chance of destroying your picture. Be careful and do not use many buttons to the same picture.
